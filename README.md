# testerMatch
This is a simpler matching system that takes two matching Criteria (Country and Device) and presents a sorted list of matched testers

This application can be executed from the command with 'python testerMatch.py'.
Then follow the input instructions to put in data path eg. 'data', country list eg. ['US'] and device list ['iPhone 4', 'iPhone 5'].
The output is a sorted list of matched testers like
   testerId firstName  lastName  bugNum
0         1    Miguel  Bautista       0
1         2   Michael   Lubavin       0
